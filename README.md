# RepoHunter

In any organization with freely working teams, there comes a time when nobody
really knows what everyone else is working on. This is especially true in the
case of javascript with the break-neck speed that the ecosystem is evolving in.

**RepoHunter** is a tool for your organization that lets you search who uses what
in your organization.
